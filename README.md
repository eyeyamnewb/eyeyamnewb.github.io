# first-website
hello, i just read an article that you can host a website via github just wanted to test it out so theres nothing much to be seen or used here

note:currently the website mostly focus on desktop specifically mine, but i'll be tuning it sometime later once im done with all the primary bits first
     so do appologize for anyone who had access this through their mobile device
